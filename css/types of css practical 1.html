                The default player skin, Steve, running across a grassy plain while carrying a Iron pickaxe. Alongside him is a tamed wolf. In
                the background, there is a pig, a chicken, a cow, a skeleton,
                a zombie, and a creeper. Mountains and cliffs fill the background, and the sky is blue, filled with clouds. Hovering over the
                scene is the Minecraft logo.

                Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by
                Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several
                early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens
                Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to
                several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly
                140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may
                discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures,
                earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as
                cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes
                include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a
                creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight.
                Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

                Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video
                games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual
                Minecon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational
                environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, 
                Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of
                spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft
                Dungeons, and the mobile game Minecraft Earth.
